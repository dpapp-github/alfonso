# examples

Each subdirectory contains a number of optimization problems solved with `alfonso` or `alfonso_simple`:
* `examples/random_lp`: solves a random linear programming problem using either interface.
* `examples/exp_design`: solves an optimal design of experiments problem.
* `examples/poly_opt`: solves various polynomial optimization problems using sum-of-squares optimization.
* `examples/portfolio`: solves a mean-risk portfolio optimization problem with a factor risk model and market impact.
