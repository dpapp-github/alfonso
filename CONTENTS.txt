ALgorithm FOr Non-Symmetric Optimization
This code is an implementation of the algorithm for non-symmetric conic 
optimization which originally appeared in:

A. Skajaa and Y. Ye, A homogeneous interior-point algorithm for nonsymmetric 
convex conic optimization, Mathematical Programming Ser. A, 150 (2015), 
pp. 391-422. Available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-014-0773-1.

The implementation is based on the corrected analysis of the algorithm
presented in:

D. Papp and S. Yildiz. On “A homogeneous interior-point algorithm for
nonsymmetric convex conic optimization”. Available at 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00492.


polyEnv.m
This code is an implementation of the sum-of-squares optimization approach 
based on non-symmetric conic optimization and polynomial interpolants 
presented in:

programming. Available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01792.

The implementation formulates and solves the polynomial envelope problem
described in the same reference.

residual3p.m
This code is an implementation of the triple-precision accumulated inner
product and residual computation. It was adapted from the code of 
Cleve Moler from a MATLAB Central Blog post which is available at
https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2015/03/02/triple-precision-accumlated-inner-product/.


ChebInterval.m
This code generates parameters for the interpolant basis representation
of univariate sum-of-squares polynomials.


PaduaSquare.m
This code generates parameters for the interpolant basis representation
of bivariate sum-of-squares polynomials.


FeketeCube.m
This code generates parameters for the interpolant basis representation
of sum-of-squares polynomials with three or more variables. It follows
the approach described in:

factorizations of Vandermonde matrices, Computers & Mathematics with
Applications, 57 (2009), pp. 1324-1336. Available at

EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS CALLED IN THE PACKAGE

chebpts, chebpolyval from Chebfun. Chebfun is an open-source package for  
numerical computing with functions: http://www.chebfun.org/.
Our code has been developed and tested with Chebfun version 5.5.0.  
The latest version of the Chebfun package can be downloaded from
http://www.chebfun.org/download/.


pdpts, pdwtsMM from Padua2DM. Padua2DM is a Matlab package from M. Caliari,
S. De Marchi, A. Sommariva, and M. Vianello for interpolation and
cubature at the Padua points. It can be downloaded from
http://profs.sci.univr.it/~caliari/software.htm.


partitions. The partitions function computes all partitions of an integer.
We use the implementation of John D'Errico from a MATLAB Central File 
Exchange post which is available at
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12009-partitions-of-an-integer.
