ALgorithm FOr Non-Symmetric Optimization
This code is an implementation of the algorithm for non-symmetric conic 
optimization which originally appeared in:

  A. Skajaa and Y. Ye, A homogeneous interior-point algorithm for
  nonsymmetric convex conic optimization, Mathematical Programming
  Ser. A, 150 (2015), pp. 391-422.
  URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-014-0773-1.

The implementation is based on the corrected analysis of the algorithm
presented in:

  D. Papp and S. Yildiz. On “A homogeneous interior-point algorithm for
  nonsymmetric convex conic optimization”.

alfonso_simple.m
This code implements a simple user-extensible interface for alfonso.


residual3p.m
This code is an implementation of the triple-precision accumulated inner
product and residual computation. It was adapted from the code of 
Cleve Moler from a MATLAB Central Blog post which is available at
https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2015/03/02/triple-precision-accumlated-inner-product/.
